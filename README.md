## 1. Project Description

Problem Solver-inator is a web-based application that accepts math problems in text or image form and returns structured, step-by-step solutions generated by AI. The application emphasizes explanation and learning rather than just giving final answers.

### Target Users

* Students (high-school / university)
* Teachers (homework checking & hints)
* Mathematicians and self-learners who want worked examples

---

## 2. Main Features

* Accepts math problems as typed text or uploaded images.
* Uses OCR to extract text from images and parse math expressions.
* Sends parsed problems to an AI service to generate step-by-step explanations.
* Stores user submissions and solution history for review.
* Optional hint mode (provides hints without revealing the full answer).

---

## 3. Why this solution is appropriate

Problem Solver-inator supports active learning by showing intermediate steps and reasoning. Instead of only providing final answers, it helps users understand the process, which improves learning outcomes and helps students build problem-solving skills.

## 4. Technology Stack

### Frontend

* Next.js (React framework)
* Tailwind CSS

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js

### Database

* PostgreSQL
* Prisma ORM

### API Type

* RESTful API (JSON)

### Authentication & Security

* JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication
* bcrypt for password hashing
* Input validation and sanitization
* Rate limiting for AI endpoints
* Environment variables for secure API key storage

### AI Integration

* OpenAI API for generating step-by-step math solutions
* Tesseract.js for OCR (image → text extraction)

### Containerization

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Deployment Plan

* Frontend: Vercel
* Backend & Database: Railway / AWS

## 5. System Architecture

Database (PostgreSQL via Prisma)   AI Service (OpenAI API)

### Components & Flow

1. **User (Browser)** — User interacts with the UI: uploads image, types problem, requests solution.
2. **Frontend (Next.js)** — Validates input client-side, shows upload progress and results, and calls backend endpoints.
3. **Backend (Node.js + Express)** — Receives requests, authenticates users (JWT), validates and sanitizes input, calls OCR when needed, formats prompts for the AI, saves records to the database, and returns structured responses to the frontend.
4. **OCR (Tesseract.js)** — If the user uploads an image, the backend runs OCR to extract text/math expressions before passing them to the AI.
5. **AI Service (OpenAI API)** — Receives a sanitized prompt containing the parsed problem and returns a step-by-step solution or hint.
6. **Database (PostgreSQL via Prisma)** — Stores users, submissions, AI responses, and usage logs.

### Security Flow

* All protected endpoints require a valid JWT.
* Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage.
* The backend performs server-side validation and sanitization for all inputs.
* AI endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse and control costs.
* API keys and secrets are stored in environment variables (never committed).

## 6. Minimal API Endpoint Skeleton (for documentation)

| Method | Endpoint                 |                               Description | Auth               |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------: | ------------------ |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register`     |                         Register new user | No                 |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`        |                        Login, returns JWT | No                 |
| POST   | `/api/problems`          |          Submit a problem (text or image) | Yes                |
| GET    | `/api/problems/:id`      |     Get solution & steps for a submission | Yes                |
| GET    | `/api/users/:id/history` |         List user submissions & solutions | Yes                |
| POST   | `/api/ai/solve`          | Internal route: send parsed problem to AI | Yes (rate-limited) |

---

## 7. AI Features (must implement at least two)

1. **OCR for image-based problems** — Tesseract.js extracts textual math expressions from images.
2. **Step-by-step solution generation** — OpenAI API provides structured explanations rather than only final answers.
3. **Hint mode (optional)** — Provide graduated hints to help learning without revealing the full solution.

---

## 8. Security & Privacy Notes

* Use bcrypt for password hashing.
* Use Prisma ORM to avoid direct SQL string construction.
* Sanitize all inputs to avoid code or prompt injection.
* Store API keys in environment variables and do not log them.
* Rate-limit AI-related endpoints and monitor usage to prevent cost overrun and abuse.
* Respect user privacy; store only necessary submission metadata and allow users to delete their data.

## 9. Week-1 Deliverables (What to commit now)

* `README.md` (this file) in the repository root — filled and committed.
* Team member names & roles included.
* High-level architecture diagram / explanation.
* Chosen technology stack.

---

## 10. Next steps (for Weeks 2–8 planning)

* Week 2: Project skeleton (Next.js project + basic routes; backend skeleton; Dockerfile).
* Week 3: Authentication (register/login) + DB schema with Prisma.
* Week 4: OCR integration + simple AI prompt pipeline.
* Week 5: Implement main solve endpoint + store results.
* Week 6: UI improvements & hint mode.
* Week 7: Testing, CI/CD, and security hardening.
* Week 8: Final polish, deployment, and presentation materials.

## Contact / Notes

If you want me to change wording, shorten sections, or produce a visual architecture diagram (PNG/SVG) to include in the repo, say so and I will update this file.
